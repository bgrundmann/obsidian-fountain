# Fountain support for obsidian.

This is the result of me realising that https://github.com/Darakah/obsidian-fountain isn't a thing
anymore  when I setup a new vault.

So I have quickly thrown together 

- fountain-js 
- the css written by Bluemoondragon07 https://forum.obsidian.md/t/pro-screenwriting-snippet-write-screenplays-in-markdown-fountain-plugin-styling-canvas-index-cards-and-well-formatted-export/62477

I still haven't done the work to package this up. Nor does it support embedded fountain blocks
(scrippets) yet. Be patient this is my first plugin and I am trying to get other things done ;-)
