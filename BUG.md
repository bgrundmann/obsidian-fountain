# Editor Plugin Recursive Update Bug - FIXED ✅

## Problem Description

There was a recursive update bug when the user was editing in CodeMirror:

1. User types in CodeMirror editor
2. `fountainEditorPlugin.update()` is called due to document change
3. Plugin calls `updateScript()` which calls `parentView.setViewData()`
4. `setViewData()` eventually calls `state.setViewData()`  
5. `state.setViewData()` calls CodeMirror's update method
6. **ERROR**: Calling CodeMirror update inside an update cycle is not allowed

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was a design flaw in how the editor plugin synchronized the cached script:

- **What's correct**: The CodeMirror document has the latest content
- **What's wrong**: The cached `parentView.cachedScript` was stale and needed updating
- **What's unnecessary**: Calling `setViewData()` triggers CodeMirror updates we don't need

When `fountainEditorPlugin.update()` runs:
- CodeMirror document is already updated (that's what triggered the update)
- We only need to update our cached parsed scripts to match
- We should NOT trigger any CodeMirror document changes

## Implementation - COMPLETED ✅

### Phase 1: Added Direct Script Update Method ✅

Added `updateScriptDirectly()` method to `FountainView` that:
- Updates the cached script without calling `setViewData()`
- Synchronizes other views for the same file
- Does NOT trigger CodeMirror updates
- Only triggers re-render for readonly views

### Phase 2: Updated Editor Plugin ✅

Modified `fountainEditorPlugin.update()` to:
- Parse the current CodeMirror document content when `docChanged`
- Call `updateScriptDirectly()` instead of going through `setViewData()`
- Build decorations with the updated script
- Updated constructor and plugin creation to use correct method signature

### Phase 3: Preserved File Saving ✅

The `EditorView.updateListener` still triggers `requestSave()` for persistence:
- Existing update listener calls `requestSave()` for file persistence
- Handles file saving asynchronously through Obsidian's vault API
- Script synchronization now handled separately from file operations

## Final Outcome - VERIFIED ✅

After the fix:
- ✅ **No recursive CodeMirror updates** - Plugin uses `updateScriptDirectly()`
- ✅ **Scripts stay synchronized across all views** - All views get updated cached scripts
- ✅ **Syntax highlighting works with current content** - Plugin has access to current parsed script
- ✅ **File saving still works properly** - Separate `requestSave()` mechanism preserved
- ✅ **Readonly views update when editor changes** - Direct script updates trigger re-renders
- ✅ **Build passes successfully** - No compilation errors

The bug has been completely resolved. The architecture now properly separates:
- **Real-time editing synchronization** → `updateScriptDirectly()`
- **File operations** → `setViewData()` + `requestSave()`
